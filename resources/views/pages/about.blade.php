		        My name is Geoffrey Karani. I'm an ingenious entrepreneur, software engineer and a technology advocate. I help ambitious developers take their coding skills to the next level.

                Ever since I wrote my first line of code in C, software development has been my passion. I still remember my first year at the university, spending my days in the computer lab, unable to get my eyes off the screen to attend my lectures. I sat in front of the computer making it print "Hello, Geoffrey!". As I went through the C tutorial, it was almost magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing in these funny little symbols, limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity.

                Throughout the university, I spent my days and nights writing code and attending software development classes even though I was not enrolled to study Software Engineering. I learned C, then PHP,  then Python, tearing through any books I could find on anything remotely related to software development. I was insatiable.

                This passion drove me to making friends with Software Engineering students at Moi University. This way I exposed myself to more resources. I studied new languages, algorithms, compilers, higher mathematics, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me earlier. And it was here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn.

                <i class="fa fa-ribbon text-info"></i>
                So, now, in industry, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.

			    I am a strong believer that everyone can learn how to code, and write sustainable and re-usable code. I also am waiting for the time when almost everyone will be able to write basic software. I have therefore made it my mission, the reason I want to teach you how to code.

			    Brace yourself for the ride! We shall enjoy, we shall write code, we shall explore, we shall solve problems, we shall succeed! See you in the course :)
